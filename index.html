	<p>Saadi was born in Shiraz, Iran, according to some, shortly after 1200, according to others sometime between 1213 and 1219.[6] In the Golestan, composed in 1258, he says in lines evidently addressed to himself, "O you who have lived fifty years and are still asleep"; another piece of evidence is that in one of his qasida poems he writes that he left home for foreign lands when the Mongols came to his homeland Fars, an event which occurred in 1225.[7] Saadi was a Sunni Muslim.[8] According to Annemarie Schimmel the tendency of Shia[9][10][11] to associate with the Sunni poet became the norm after Twelver Shiaism became the state religion of the Safavid Empire.[12]</p>
